# Git Hands-on: Merge Conflict Resolution

## **Objective**

This step demonstrates how to handle merge conflicts in Git by creating conflicting changes in two branches, resolving them, and completing the merge.

---

## **Steps Performed**

### **1. Create and switch to a new branch**

```bash
git checkout -b Gitwork
```

A new branch `Gitwork` is created and checked out.

---

### **2. Create a file in Gitwork**

```bash
echo "Hello from branch" > hello.xml
```

The file `hello.xml` is created with the text *"Hello from branch"*.

---

### **3. Commit in Gitwork**

```bash
git commit -m "Branch hello.xml"
```

*(This commit didnâ€™t succeed initially because the file was not staged.)*

---

### **4. Switch back to master and create a conflicting change**

```bash
git checkout master
echo "Hello from master" > hello.xml
git add hello.xml
git commit -m "Master hello.xml"
```

The same file name `hello.xml` is created in `master` but with different content (*"Hello from master"*).

---

### **5. Merge Gitwork into master**

```bash
git merge Gitwork
```

This would normally create a merge conflict because the same file has different contents.
However, in this run, Git showed **"Already up to date"**, meaning there was no conflict detected at that time.

---

### **6. Add and commit after resolving**

```bash
git add hello.xml
git commit -m "Resolved conflict in hello.xml"
```

The resolved version of `hello.xml` is staged and committed.

---

### **7. Delete the Gitwork branch**

```bash
git branch -d Gitwork
```

Removes the merged branch `Gitwork` from the local repository.

## **Conclusion**

In this step, you:

* Created a branch and made changes to a file.
* Made different changes to the same file in master.
* Merged branches and ensured the final version was committed.
* Deleted the feature branch after successful merge.
