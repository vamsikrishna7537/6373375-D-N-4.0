# Git Hands-on: Using .gitignore to Ignore Log Files and Folders

## **Objective**

The goal of this step is to demonstrate how to create a `.gitignore` file to exclude certain files and directories (like log files) from being tracked in Git.

---

## **Steps Performed**

### **1. Create a log file**

```bash
echo "Some log" > debug.log
```

This creates `debug.log` with the text *"Some log"*.

---

### **2. Create a logs directory and error log**

```bash
mkdir logs
echo "Error log" > logs/error.txt
```

A directory `logs` is created, and `error.txt` inside it contains the text *"Error log"*.

---

### **3. Create a `.gitignore` file**

```bash
echo "*.log" > .gitignore
echo "logs/" >> .gitignore
```

This tells Git to ignore:

* Any file ending with `.log` (e.g., `debug.log`)
* The entire `logs/` directory

---

### **4. Stage and commit `.gitignore`**

```bash
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Ignore log files and logs folder"
```

The `.gitignore` file is tracked and committed to the repository.

---

### **5. Attempt to push to remote**

```bash
git push
```

**Result:** Git shows:

```
fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
```

This means the branch has not been linked to a remote repository yet.

---

## **Next Step to Push**

If you have a remote repository set up, link and push:

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin master
```

After this, future pushes can be done simply with:

```bash
git push
```

## **Conclusion**

In this step, you successfully:

* Created files and folders to be ignored
* Configured `.gitignore` to exclude them from Git tracking
* Committed the `.gitignore` file
* Learned that pushing requires linking the local branch to a remote first
Do you want me to **extend this README** so it covers your **entire Git hands-on from start to finish** including this `.gitignore` part?
That way youâ€™ll have one complete report to submit.
